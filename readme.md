# OCR NER

## Objective:

Extract the text from a PDF file and redact the personal information (ID, names, dates), and save the result into a CSV.

## Installation:

- Create environment (optional)
- Install tesseract: Follow [link](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/ocr/blog/ocr-tools/install-tesseract/), [link](https://medium.com/@nothanjack/easy-installation-of-tesseract-ocr-on-debian-12-terminal-walkthrough-13120ec7d98c).
- Install python requirements
```
python -m pip install -r requirements
```
- Install NER model from spacy (other models: en_core_web_sm, en_core_web_md, en_core_web_trf)
```
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
```

## Methodology

As methodology, I use tesseract for OCR the PDF file, then the text is processed with a general model from spacy to tag  Named Entities (NER). As "IDs" is not exactly a NAMED ENTITY, a simple REGEX is used for capture the IDs in the text. Finally all information is saved in a csv file with columns ENTITY and LABEL.


## Execution:

```
python extract_phi_data.py --help

usage: PDF OCR Extraction for PHI data [-h] [--file FILE] [--report REPORT]

This systems helps toextract PHI data form a PDF.

options:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --file FILE      filepath of the PDF file
  --report REPORT  filepath of the extracted phi data as a csv file
```

## Result for sample_file.pdf:
```

## Future improvements

- This is an automatic PHI data extractor using general models. Tranning for specific cases could improve accuracy.
- Tesseract is used for OCR, but in some cases like ID S2222222Z is not read well ($2222222Z), thus the regex can't find this ID.
- Further postprocessing for the entities in the models could be performed.
